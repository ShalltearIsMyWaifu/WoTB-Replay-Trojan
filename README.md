# Replay Trojan
### World of Tanks Blitz Replay Trojan

This is a tool to dynamically compile first stage executables that will 
mimic a .wotbreplay.



### Obfuscation techniques

1. Official WoT Blitz icon set as executable icon
2. `right-to-left-override` character used to obfuscate file extension


### Usability instructions

#### - The project requires a complete file tree to function properly

#### - The editable configuration values are all in `FirstStagePayload.cs`.

#### - Malicious, second-stage payload is not included
